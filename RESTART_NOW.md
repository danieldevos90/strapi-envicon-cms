# 🔄 RESTART STRAPI NOW - Everything is Ready!

## ✅ What I Just Fixed:

1. ✅ Cleaned Strapi cache and old build files
2. ✅ Rebuilt Strapi completely with all content types
3. ✅ Created import script with your API token
4. ✅ Everything is ready to go!

## 🚨 NEXT STEP: Restart Strapi (REQUIRED!)

The build is complete but **Strapi MUST be restarted** for the routes to work.

### In the terminal where Strapi is running:

1. **Press `Ctrl+C`** to stop Strapi
2. **Start it again:**
   ```bash
   npm run develop
   ```
3. **Wait** for it to fully start (browser opens)

## ✅ Then Import Content

Once Strapi restarts, run this in the **strapi-cms** directory:

```bash
./import-now.sh
```

Or use the full command:
```bash
STRAPI_API_TOKEN=e2c0bd68fa83454f2d86087aed732a1754ac87d277cb2bfb3f9aac0b1cdd883fcda4c7d97bbfb22df3fba6e62985d8c2933f7eb09ff2b503ec4773a86d28ea93f89e14ed3575
