🚨 CRITICAL: STRAPI MUST BE RESTARTED
================================================================================

The routes are returning "405 Method Not Allowed" because Strapi needs to be
FULLY RESTARTED after the rebuild for routes to register properly.

================================================================================
DO THIS NOW (Takes 30 seconds):
================================================================================

1. In the terminal where Strapi is running:
   
   Press: Ctrl+C  (to stop Strapi completely)
   
2. Wait 3 seconds for it to fully stop

3. Start it again:
   
   npm run develop
   
4. Wait for the console to show:
   
   ✅ Default admin user created successfully!
   📧 Email:    admin@envicon.nl  
   🔑 Password: Envicon2024!Admin
   
5. Once you see that, run:
   
   node auto-setup-and-import.js
   
================================================================================

WHY THIS IS NEEDED:
- Strapi was rebuilt with new content types
- The running process has old route configurations
- A restart loads the new routes properly

================================================================================
AFTER RESTART:
- All API endpoints will work
- Import script will succeed
- Content Manager will show all types
- Everything will work! ✅

================================================================================

DO IT NOW: Ctrl+C → npm run develop → Wait → node auto-setup-and-import.js
